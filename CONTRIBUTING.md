Curio exists to serve the Filecoin ecosystem: specifically the needs of Storage Providers.
Its design follows one principle: build only what a consortium of SPs would intentionally create for themselves on top of the Filecoin Node APIs.

Curio is an integration of the best Filecoin tools that can work together to meet the common SP needs. 

To protect interoperability and avoid ecosystem fragmentation, Curio avoids arbitrary configuration that deviate from common standards.
