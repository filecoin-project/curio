			Comment: `EnableSealSDRTrees enables the SDR pipeline tree-building task to run.
This task handles encoding of unsealed data into last sdr layer and building
of TreeR, TreeC and TreeD.

This task runs after SDR
TreeD is first computed with optional input of unsealed data
TreeR is computed from replica, which is first computed as field
addition of the last SDR layer and the bottom layer of TreeD (which is the unsealed data)
TreeC is computed from the 11 SDR layers
The 3 trees will later be used to compute the PoRep proof.

In case of SyntheticPoRep challenges for PoRep will be pre-generated at this step, and trees and layers
will be dropped. SyntheticPoRep works by pre-generating a very large set of challenges (~30GiB on disk)
then using a small subset of them for the actual PoRep computation. This allows for significant scratch space
saving between PreCommit and PoRep generation at the expense of more computation (generating challenges in this step)

Valid values: "off", "self", "inline" (Default: "inline")

Since storage providers serve user-uploaded content on their domain, CSP helps control
what these files can do when rendered in browsers. Choose based on your use case:

- "off": No CSP headers. Content can load any external resources and execute any scripts.
Use only if you fully trust all stored content or need maximum compatibility.

- "self": Restricts content to only load resources from your domain. Prevents external
resource loading but allows stored HTML/JS/CSS to interact with each other.
Good for semi-trusted content that needs internal functionality.

- "inline": (Default) Allows inline scripts/styles and same-origin resources. Provides
basic protection while maintaining compatibility with most web content.
Suitable for general-purpose content hosting.

Note: Stricter policies may prevent some HTML content from displaying as intended.
Consider the trust level of your users and whether you need to support interactive content.`,
