## 1.  Joining the Marketplace
1.1 Register a Filecoin actor ID, digital‑signature key, and minimum price (in FIL) through the Provider API.  
1.2 You warrant that you (i) are not a citizen or resident of, nor located in, any country or region subject to U.S./EU/UK sanctions, and (ii) are not listed on any OFAC, EU, U.K., or U.N. sanctions list.

## 2.  Work Matching & Payment
2.1 Tasks are matched automatically to the lowest‑price eligible Provider; you receive a signed **service voucher**.  
2.2 Upon valid proof submission, you may redeem that voucher on‑chain; payment is disbursed directly from the hub contract to your Filecoin address.  
2.3 All amounts are denominated in FIL; we do **not** convert or transmit fiat currency.  
2.4 You are solely responsible for any taxes associated with the payments you receive.

## 3.  Fees
3.1 The Service adds a transparent service fee to each task.  
3.2 The fee is deducted automatically before voucher redemption; no additional invoices or accounting are provided.

### 3A.  Hub‑Contract Lifecycle
The current hub contract may be **upgraded, migrated, or abandoned**. If we publish an end‑of‑life date, you must redeem any un‑cashed service vouchers **before** that date. Afterward, withdrawal of any remaining funds is solely your responsibility.

### 3B.  Operator Changes
The Service may in future be operated by a community DAO or another legal entity elected by the DAO. All rights and obligations herein will automatically transfer to the successor operator.

## 4.  No Agency; No Money‑Services Business
We provide **technical routing only**. We neither hold user funds for longer than technically necessary nor allow users to direct payments to third parties. Nothing herein creates an agency, partnership, or employment relationship.

## 5.  Performance & Availability
5.1 The Service is experimental and may be interrupted, suspended, or modified at any time. You bear all risk of network congestion, chain re‑orgs, or smart‑contract defects.
5.2 All requests for service are to be handled promptly and with similar intent to complete the task before the service-enforced deadline. Attempted service disruption or targeted client disruption is in violation of this contract and may constitute Criminal Mischief, Disruption of Business Activity, Denial of Service, or similar crimes.

## 6.  Intellectual Property
6.1 You grant Clients a non‑exclusive license to use proofs you generate solely for Filecoin network purposes.  
6.2 You retain all other rights in your proprietary tooling.
6.3 None of the service-provided inputs can be regarded as your intellectual property and must be discarded immediately after performance of the service.

## 7.  Warranties & Liability
**No warranties.** The Service, smart contracts, software, L2 chain, and APIs are provided **“as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement.**  
**Limitation.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are **not liable** for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages; our aggregate liability is limited to the greater of (i) USD 100 or (ii) the fees we earned on tasks you completed in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 8.  Termination
Either party may terminate at any time; Sections 4–7 survive termination.

## 9.  Governing Law
Delaware law governs, excluding conflict‑of‑law rules. Exclusive venue is the state or federal courts in Wilmington, Delaware.
