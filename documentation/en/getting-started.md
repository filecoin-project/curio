# Getting Started

## Compatibility

This is the Curio and Lotus compatibility matrix.

| Curio Version | Lotus Version | Go Version |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1.22.0        | v1.27.0       | 1.21.7     |
| 1.22.1        | v1.27.x       | 1.22.3     |

## Curio Database and Distributed Architecture

### Familiarizing Yourself with Curio

Before diving into the setup and configuration of Curio, we highly recommend becoming familiar with [Curio's design and fundamental principles](design/). This foundational knowledge will greatly assist in effective administration and troubleshooting.

### **HarmonyDB with YugabyteDB**

Curio utilizes YugabyteDB to create an abstraction layer known as HarmonyDB. This HarmonyDB serves two primary purposes:

1. **Metadata Storage**: It stores all Curio-related metadata.
2. **Consensus Layer**: It establishes a consensus layer for the distributed architecture of a Curio cluster.

We recommend using at least 3 node YugabyteDB cluster for HA and scalability. Loss of the DB will render Curio dead. YugabyteDB should also be backed up regularly.
{% endhint %}

### Key Features of HarmonyDB

* **High Availability**: Ensures that the metadata and consensus information is always available, even in the event of node failures.
* **Scalability**: Capable of handling increasing amounts of data and expanding as the Curio cluster grows.
* **Consistency**: Maintains data consistency across the distributed nodes of the Curio cluster.

### Benefits of Using YugabyteDB for HarmonyDB

* **Distributed SQL**: Combines the benefits of SQL with the resilience and scalability of a distributed database.
* **Fault Tolerance**: Provides strong fault tolerance, ensuring the reliability of the Curio cluster.
* **Multi-Region Deployment**: Supports deployment across multiple regions for improved performance and redundancy.

## Chain Node

Curio requires access to at least one Filecoin chain node like [Lotus](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/get-started/what-is-lotus/) or [Forest](https://docs.forest.chainsafe.io/) (integration in progress). This chain node is used by Curio to get the current chain state and send messages to the chain. Curio support using multiple chain nodes.

## Network

Following port must be opened on each Curio node for API and GUI access



| Port  | Details                                                                                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12300 | Default API port                                                                              |
| 4701  | Default GUI port. Not all Curio nodes are required to enable GUI                              |
| 32100 | Market Port. This port is determined by the user when enabling Boost access in configuration. |

## Boost Compatibility

Boost is fully compatible with Curio and can be used for making deals and retrieving the data same as `lotus-miner`. The version compatibility guide can be found in [Boost documentation](https://boost.filecoin.io/getting-started#boost-and-lotus-compatibility-matrix).

## Installing Curio and creating a Curio cluster

With an understanding of Curio's internal mechanisms, you can now proceed to [install the Curio binaries](installation.md). We recommend using [Debian packages](installation.md#debian-package-installation) for the installation, as they facilitate easy installation, upgrades, and process management. After installing your first Curio binary, you can move on to [setting up Curio](setup.md), whether you are [migrating from lotus-miner](setup.md#migrating-from-lotus-miner-to-curio) or [initializing a new minerID](setup.md#initiating-a-new-curio-cluster).

## Best Practices

We have compiled [a list of best practices](getting-started.md#best-practices) for deploying and maintaining a Curio cluster. All users are encouraged to follow these recommendations to avoid potential issues.

New users should also familiarize themselves with [both binaries shipped with Curio](curio-cli/) and the [GUI pages](curio-gui.md).
